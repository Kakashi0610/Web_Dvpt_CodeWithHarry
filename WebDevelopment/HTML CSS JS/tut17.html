# Stacked-Fonts : It is the collection of different font styles, which can act as an alternative if some fonts can't be 
available by the Operating System.

# To add Web-fonts :
- search Google Fonts, choose any font you wish to write the data in, and scroll down to select a font by clicking on + sign.
- Once you click on + , the font is added to the list, you can check it on right most corner window tab besides settings.
- Copy the link for the Html and paste it below the title in the header section. Then copy the CSS fontstyle and paste it in 
  Internal or External CSS element property like parah or div or span or header.
- These can be auto-tagg links in both HTML and CSS, so we dont need to open any tags in either fields.
