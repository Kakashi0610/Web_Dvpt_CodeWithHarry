tut5 : Headings, Paraghraphs and Emmets.

USE Alt + z for rearraging data which exceeds the display limit

# for adding the heading, use the <h1></h1> tag : 
- We can create heading tags simultaneously using - h * (num of req. headings) 
- We can add upto 6 headings ie till <h6></h6>.
- The size of the heading decreases as the number of heading tags increases.
- Adding a seventh heading will create a default string, not a heading.
- However, we can add multiple <h1></h1> heading tags.
- Heading tags are not for adjusting the font size, but for declaring the HEADING in the webpage.

# for adding parahgraphs, use the <p></p> tag :
- We can type numerous number of paragraphs.
- Size DOESNT decrease with increase in parahgraphs.
- we can create number of parah in one instance by - p * (num of req. parahs)

# for emmet, use the Lorem keyword :
- to enable a default random parahgraph for exapmleistic representation of parah in a webpage or website.

# for applying bold font to a string in a parah, use <strong></strong> :
- This will turn the string into Bold font.

# for applying the Italic font to a string in a parah, use embedded tags <em></em> :
- This will turn the string into Italic font.

# for 'break' tag, use the <br> :
- It is a self closing tag.
- This will allow us to break the line after the sentence and new string will start from the NEXT line.
- We can use multiple break tags in one line w.r.t. the lines we want to skip.
- USING A BREAK TAG IS NOT A GOOD PRACTICE IN HTML.

# for hr tag, use <hr> :
- It is a self closing tag.
- It is used to print a horizontal line in a full screen view, skipping the previous line of the parah or heading or a string.

# For using the bold italic and Underlined font directly by <b></b> <i></i> <u></u> :
- can access the bold italic and Underlined fonts directly, instead of strong and emphasized.
