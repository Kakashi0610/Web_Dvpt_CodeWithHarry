tut9 - Inline and Block elements

Inline Elements/Tags - Inline elements/tags are the type of elemnts/tags which can be written in a seperate line using two or more tags, 
but only allocate the space thatis assigned. They do not take over the entire block.

Example : 
<span>this is first span line</span>
<span>this is second span line</span>

output :
this is first span line this is second span line

Block Elements/Tags - Block elements/tags are the type of tags which allocate the whole block of line even if the value is not 
parallely assigned by the user. Sigle tag takes up full block even if another line is written besides it.

Example :
<p>this is a parah</p> <p>This is another parah</p>

output :
this is a parah 
This is another parah

# following are the INLINE TAGS - span, img, em, a.
# following are the BLOCK TAGS - ul, ol, p, h1.
