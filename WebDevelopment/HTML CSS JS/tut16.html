# by inspecting the webpage or website, We can :

- We can click on the Select-an-Element key (arrow key) besides the Mobile/Desktop-view key in the top menu-bar.

- By doing this, we can manually select which element we want to explore and its parameters for designing by CSS and also the 
  Structure of HTML tags.

- Clicking in specific parameter of element, we can alter the border, background , any text, any color, any CSS and HTML related task 
  in the real world (temporarily).

- We can also write half html in Visual Basic and half CSS in the text editor in the Elements section.

- This proves useful to explore big websites and learn few tricks and also gather a visualization of how things work temporarily
  rather than saving things again and again.

- If we refresh the website/ webpage, the edited info refreshes and switches to default website parameters and properties.
